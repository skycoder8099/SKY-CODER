            <h2>Introduction to Computer</h2>
            <p><mark>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation).
                 Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
                 These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. </mark>
                The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; 
                or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

            <h2>What is Computer</h2>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that is capable of accepting, storing and proccessing data according to instruction to performed various operations.
                Every computer OS a combination of two basic components: Software and Hardware. Computer can be divided in three main catagories:<br>
                (a) Analog Computer.
                (b) Digital Computer.
                (c) Hybrid Computer.

            <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
            <p><b>Computer Hardware:</b> Computer Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. <br>
            <b>Computer Software:</b> Software is a set of instructions that tells the computer about the tasks to be performed and how 
        these tasks are to be performed.</p>

            <h2>About input and output devices </h2>
            <p>I/O stands for input/output, which is the process by which computers communicate with the outside world. I/O devices are hardware 
                that allows a computer to send and receive data from other systems or peripherals devices.<br>
                <br>
                <ul>Here are some things to know about I/O devices:</ul>
                <ul>1. Input devices are used to enter data into the computer.</ul>
                <ul>2. Output devices are used to display data from the computer.</ul>
            <b>Input and Output</b><br>
            Input refers to data sent to a computer, while output refers to data that has been processed and comes from the computer.<br>
            <b>Examples</b><br>
            Some examples of input devices include keyboards and mice, while monitors and printers are examples of output devices.

            <h2>About CPU</h2>
            <p>The CPU, or central processing unit, is the brain of the computer. It is also known as the processor or microprocessor, is the primary component of a computer that executes most instructions and tasks.<br>
                The CPU is the brain of a computer, performing mathematical operations on data and converting it into digital signals. It fetches instructions from memory, 
            executes them, and sends the results back to memory.<br>
            The CPU works through a fetch-execute cycle,where it first fetches an instruction from memory,then decodes and executes it.
        </p>

            <h2>What is Memory</h2>
            <p>Computer memory is just like a human brain, which store data and information program for temporeraly or permanently.</p>
            <ul>There are two types of memory</ul>
            <ol>a) Primary memory <br>
                b) Secondary memory
            </ol>
            <b>Primary Memory</b><br>
           <p> Primary memory is also known as the main memory of the computer which can store data and information temporarily. It is the memory that is directly accessible by the CPU.</p><br>
           <b>Types of Primary Memory</b><br>
           <p>There are some types of primary memory:<br>
            <ul>
                a) RAM (Random Access Memory)<br>
                b) ROM (Read Only Memory)<br>
                c) EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)<br>
                d) EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)<br>
            </ul>
           </p>
            <b>Secondary Memory</b><br>
            <p>Secondary memory is also known as external memory that can store data and information permanently.
            It is non-volatile memory means stored data and information is not lost even when the power is off.</p>
            <b>Types of Secondary Memory</b><br>
            <p>There are some types of secondary memory:<br>
                <ul>
                a) Hard Disk<br>
                b) Floppy Disk<br>
                c) CD/DVD<br>
                d) USB
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Internal Memory</b><br>
                Internal memory is also known as main memory or primary memory, which van directly access by the CPU.<br>
                <b>External Memory</b><br>
                External memory is also known as secondary memory, It is a storage capacity wich can store data and information permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What is RAM?</b><br>
                RAM is a type of primary memory that stores data and information temporarily. It is used to store the data and information that is being processed by the CPU.<br>
                <ul> </ul>
                <b>What is ROM?</b><br>
                ROM is a type of primary memory that stores data and information permanently. It is used to store the data and information that is being processed by the CPU.
